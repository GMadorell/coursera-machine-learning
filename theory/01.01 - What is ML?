WHAT IS ML?

ML: Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicity programmed.

More recent definition:
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with E.

ML algs:
	- Supervised learning.
	- Unsupervised learning.
	- Reinforcement learning.
	- Recommender systems.


SUPPERVISED LEARNING
The datased has the right answers for the training data.

 - Regression: Predict continuous valued output (price house based on m2, for example).
 - Classification: Predict discrete valued output (cancer, benign vs malignant based 
   on its size, for example).


UNSUPERVISED LEARNING
The dataset DOES NOT have the answers for the training data.

 - Clustering:
	Algos create clusters with the datasets and try to separate points into different groups.

	Ex: organize computing clusters, market segmentation, social network analysis, astronomical data analysis.
